Hi! 

This is the website I've worked on as part of applying my learnings when I took up an Intro to Web Development course from codepath. 

The proposed website introduces habit-building and tracking to teach a positive growth mindset. The website will contain several well-known and effective strategies that can help one lead a better life like journaling, habit tracking, positive affirmations, community support, and many others. The goal is to focus on tiny details and gamify the experience to increase user engagement. 

The intended users are anyone ready to take charge of their lives and improve them. Users between the ages of 16 to 30  are most likely to use the website but are not limited to it.

The user needs to create an account on the website and log in to it where they will be presented with all the functionalities that come with the website. Users can set goals and share what they are comfortable with on the website. The core of the website relies on gamification to encourage the user to interact more with the website.
