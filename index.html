    <h2 id="about">About My Topic</h2>

    <p>The Problem: In an increasingly fast-paced and digitally-driven world, the pursuit of happiness often takes a
      back seat. Stress, anxiety, and societal pressures can lead to a decline in mental well-being, resulting in lower
      overall happiness levels for individuals. This is not just a personal issue; it has significant societal
      implications. When a large portion of the population experiences low levels of happiness, it can impact
      productivity, relationships, and overall quality of life.</p>
    <p>I am working towards building a webpage that is impactful to the user.</p>
    <p>The proposed website introduces habit building and tracking as part of inculcating a positive growth mindset. The
      website will contain several well known and effective strategies that can help one lead a better life like
      journaling, habit tracking, positive affirmations, community support and many others. The goal is to pay attention
      to tiny details and gamify the experience to increase user engagement.</p>
    <p>The intended users are anyone who is ready to take up charge for their lives and improve it. Users between the
      ages 16 to 30 are most likely to use the website but are not limited to it.</p>
    <p>The user needs to create an account on the website and login to it where they will be presented with all
      functionalities that come with the website. Users can set goals and share what they are comfortable with the
      website. The core of the website relies on gamification in order to encourage the user to interact more with the
      website. </p>

    <h3>Workplace</h3>
    <p>The workplace is one area where the decline in happiness can have significant consequences. Unhappy employees are
      less engaged, less productive, and more likely to experience burnout. This can result in higher turnover rates and
      lower company morale, ultimately affecting the bottom line.</p>
    <p>When employees are unhappy, they are less motivated to perform their best, leading to decreased productivity and
      innovation. Additionally, unhappy employees are more likely to take sick days or leave their jobs altogether,
      creating instability within the organization.</p>

      alt="A happy student" />
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>Education is another critical area where the decline in happiness can have lasting effects. Unhappy students are
      less likely to engage in their studies, leading to lower academic achievement and higher dropout rates. This can
      perpetuate a cycle of underachievement and limit opportunities for future success.</p>
    <p>When students are unhappy, they may struggle to concentrate in class, participate in extracurricular activities,
      or build positive relationships with peers and teachers. This can hinder their overall academic progress and limit
      their potential for future career opportunities.</p>

      alt="A happy person">
    <h3>Society</h3>
    <p>Mental health is a broader societal issue that is deeply impacted by levels of happiness. High levels of stress
      and unhappiness can contribute to the development of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. This
      not only affects individuals on a personal level but also places a significant burden on healthcare systems and
      social support networks.</p>
    <p> Mental health disorders have far-reaching consequences, affecting individuals' ability to work, maintain
      relationships, and participate fully in society. Without proper intervention and support, the long-term effects of
      untreated mental health disorders can be devastating, leading to increased rates of disability, homelessness, and
      even suicide.</p>
